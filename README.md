# Julian Sweatt's Resumé
 This is the source code for resume.juliansweatt.com

# Plan
Currently, this sit is used as a personal resume website. I plan to add to this personal website by creating a stylized home page centered around easily linking my other media accounts together.

This site will be used as the basis for a future public resumé builder project.

# Build
To build the website use `ng build --base-href ./ --prod`

# Development
To run the Angular development server use `ng serve`
